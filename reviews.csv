comparison with Mi Band  ,ElonFromSpace,5,  This is going to be a long review  scroll to the end for summery  I have already been using Mi band   for over a year so I will compare with it wherever required   SCREEN  Screen is just gorgeous  it is full touch AMOLED    inch  which is almost     bigger than my Mi band   s     inch  you will instantly appreciate the extra real estate  Everything is crisp and bright  there is is anti fingerprint coating  which works  but sadly no gorilla glass  And it is very hard to find and put screen guard due to it is curved glass  My MB  has many scratches after a year of use and I expect the same in MB   Display is clearly visible under direct sunlight   STRAP and COMFORT  Strap is rubbery plastic  same as Mi Band   but size is different  so MB  strap will not fit here  It does not produce much sweat and overall  it is light and comfortable  you will forget it is on your wrist after a while  Band is also non intrusive while sleeping  I have also wore My band in drizzle  while washing hands and in full blown rain  it is totally waterproof   BATTERY  Battery has always been a big plus on Mi Band series  I used to get around       days battery on Mi Band   with continuous heart rate monitor enables and     days without it  In Mi band    my battery is     after   days of use  so seems like battery life is almost same as before  BUT the charging mechanism has changed  I think it is one of the most significant upgrade since Mi Band    It was very inefficient and cluttery but now it is simply a breeze  You do not have to remove the tracker now so strap life may also improve  who knows EXTRA FEATURES  Mi band   and Mi band   both has lift to wake  timer  stopwatch  weather up to   days  vibration alarm  ideal sitting alert  music and volume change  find my phone feature  You can silent the phone from band  Receive notifications from phone  dismiss notifications  Reject and silent calls and change the brightness of the band from band itself  All the features are very refinedand works without any problem or bug whatever  Mi band   also has remote shutter control to capture images from phone HEALTH TRACKING and FEATURES  Now the most important part  All other features are useless if the band can not track properly  Mi band   had   big flaws in sleep tracking   it could not track REM sleep and could not track mid day naps  Fortunately  both the features are included in Mi band    It is a significant change and my favourite upgrade after the charger  Other sleep tracking features are as accurate as ever  Xiaomi claims that they have improved the heart rate sensor but I am getting almost same reading on both Mi Band   and    with      point difference   Mi band   now has some new indoor sports mode which gym lovers will love  It has indoor cycling  rowing machine and Elliptical  although the data you get in this is very limited  It also has Yoga mode now  which is not very accurate   Step counter is ok ish  with        accuracy roughly  but the running mode is wonderful with connected GPS  your phone s  it provides so much data like pace  stride rate  average heart rate  real time heart rate  map  average speed  personal best and so on  you will love running after wearing Mi band  Mi band   includes new stress meter  which is fun to use  just take its data with a pinch of salt   and PAI  personal activity index  about which I will update the review after some use  Tracking feature of Mi band   are best for any fitness tracker under Rs   k I am going to  Moreover  all the features are very refined and well designed  you will not encounter any bug or hiccups while using them  they just work as expected    CONS  Now some flaws  Design is very outdated  Although it is comfortable but It looks very small if you have big hands   The stripping mechanism is also not very good  I was expecting that Xiaomi will improve it at least a bit in this upgrade but seems like I will have to wait another year   The weather feature does not work most of the time  It says  connect the band to show weather   even though I am connected  Same problem was there in MB    Seems like Xiaomi ignored it   Xiaomi should introduce some metallic straps  There are  rd party straps available but their quality is just bad   Ads in android app  Ruins the whole experience   No SpO  meter  Although not as useful  but still good to have   No scratch resistent glass  or at least provide good first party curved tempered glass CONCLUSION  Mi Band   is not as significant an upgrade as MB   to    But the magnetic charger  improved sleep tracking and indoor sports mode are all excellent upgrade  Not to mention the extra screen estate  As for the first time buyers  Mi band is the most accurate band you will get under Rs   k  No other band or watch in this range have such polished UI  reliable tracking and fine hardware quality Edit  I will update add some photos of band and screenshots of tracking data soon ,2057

with Mi Band      ,Sameer Patil,3,  NOTE  If you are looking for Best Accurate Fitness Band under  K price   SpO   Oximeter  feature is your priority  then directly go and buy Honor Band    do not even bother reading this review any further Now for those not having above mentioned priorities or looking to upgrade their older Mi bands  I am already using this Band since Last   month  so this review is Based on over   Month of heavy usage  Being satisfied with its performance  I decided to buy one more from amazon  there is NO SpO  or Voice Assistant feature in this band  so note that  Straps of MI band   will not fit this Band  Has Lower battery backup compared to Mi band     check the review for Detailed Battery backup   This band can now track Day time sleep  but that is limited between   pm to  pm This is very long review divided into   parts namely  Quick Overview  Full Detailed review and Comparison of it with Mi Band    So if you are really looking to invest      rupees or looking to upgrade over previous gen Mi Bands  then I highly advice to read it completely  to ease your decision  If you want to get quick overview of the device  then read below else scroll down for Detailed Review  The Screen is Full Touch Coloured AMOLED with    D slightly curved at the edges   Brightness is Adjustable   It is prone to shatter if falls on face  Has LOWER Battery backup compared to Mi Band    but more than Honor Band    Its very Light weight and compact  The Strap is extremely comfortable and also replaceable   This time MI have improved the strap design by giving deeper grooves  which will avoid accidental fallouts  Has Full Whatsapp  Instagram  Message  Call  etc Notification alerts  Has NO SpO  or Voice assistant feature yet  while writing this review  Updates are not very Frequent  Connects to both android and iOS  without any problem  Has Customizable watch faces via default app and  rd party installation is also possible  Watch interface is Clean and easy to use   has more customization options   But there is NO sleep tracker TAB on the band  For that you have to use App  Has averagely accurate built in Continuous Heart Rate monitoring and Sleep Tracker and Highly accurate Pedometer  It is swimming safe as well  but touch panel is useless once water touches the screen   You will have to dry wipe the screen for proper touch functioning Charging dock is magnetic  so you need not remove the capsule like previous Mi band versions  Finally  I think Price does not justify the features  Full Detailed Review  DESIGN                   It have slim profile and bigger         D display surrounded by black bezels perfectly blends in  It is extremely Light as well  It has Circular Touch sensitive Touch button  which is almost invisible   But its NOT Home button  It is just back button  which is not very handy  It has   pin contact charging dock facing down  but now the capsule does not needs to be taken out  as charging dock is magnetically attached   Finally Quality of the strap is same as previous versions and feels comfortable  DISPLAY                    It sports      AMOLED Colour display which gives crystal clear output  The display module is Rectangular with Vibrant colours and Bright Light  Adjustable upto   Levels   Its very responsive and has good readability even in direct sunlight as well  FEATURES                     It has    Main modes namely Daily activity tracker  Heart Rate sensor  Workout  Weather  Notifications  PAI  Stress  Breathing  Events and More  settings  In Activity tracker  complete pedometer and calories details of the day are mentioned   Its     accurate according to my usage  In Heart rate sensor  you can quickly check the heart rate and it displays it in continuous manner for few seconds before it stops   Its very SLOW heart rate tracker and NOT very accurate as well   You can even set heart rate tracking on Continuous mode from the app  This band has Sleep tracking feature  but NO sleep tracker data TAB on band itself   To check the data you need to use the app   It  finally has the day time sleep data  but it works only between   pm to  pm   Its decently accurate sleep tracker  but not as accurate as honor band series  In Workout mode  there are many in built modes like walking  running  swimming  free exercise  Cycling and Yoga  etc  there is NO GPS in the band  but you can track your session with GPS if connected with phone while that session   Note that  you do not need to carry you phone while workout session  if you do not need GPS data   there is continuous heart rate tracking in any workout mode  In weather tab  you get to see the current day weather of your location   there is also full week s forecast in it  In Notification option  you can check all your smartphone notifications when connected to it   It supports phone message  whatsapp messages  etc  And you can read the complete message   It also supports call notifications  which has call Rejection and Silent option as well   You also get direct notification and sedentary alerts on band without needing to check the message option  In EVENTS  all the saved reminders in the mi fit app shall get the vibrating alert once those events tick in  This indeed is very practical and handy feature  PAI  STRESS   BREATHING I personally think are forced fitted and majority of the users will not even bother to open them up  I did not in last   months  so I will not waste time explaining them  Suffices to it that they go by names  except PAI has some women centric features  which again were not really useful  In MORE  there are various micro settings and more features like camera shutter  world clock  Timer  stop watch  Watch faces  Reboot  etc   Its very thoughtful to put extra settings or feature in the more option  so as to keep the interface clean  Watch Faces                        There are out of the box   watch faces on the band  Using the MI Fit app you can choose from more than    watch faces  It also supports  rd party watch face installation  which is a charm  Now there is support for even Live watch faces  BATTERY PERFORMANCE                                       It charges quite quickly from   to      within an hour  With band not connected to bluetooth  not in continuous HR mode lasts more than    Days   OFFLINE MODE   With Bluetooth connected and Continuous HR mode  it lasts upto       Days  If Fitness app is used for about a hour or more with sleep assistant ON  then it lasts upto    Days max All these data are lower compared to Mi band   which has    days     days      days backup respectively for each scenario  CONS               there is NO SpO  feature  which Honor is giving since      and considering its importance in current situation  Unnecessary loading of modes like Stress and Breathing  which are not practical in todays world  I mean why would you need an band to sit for a minute and breath   And speaking of stress calculator  I never got close to decent reading from it in   months  NO Smart tracking mode in Heart Rate Tracking yet  Here again Honor has this since       Takes least a minute to connect to phone each time   need bluetooth as well as Location ON  least for me and FYI I am using it with Redmi K    which belong to same company s umbrella  can not view Detailed Sleep tracking on the band itself  You will need the companion app for that  To Turn the band ON every time  you need to connect charging dock to it  COMPARISON with Mi Band                                                Design section  Both being very similar in appearance  MI band   has advantage of magnetic dock Winner   Mi Band      Display section  Though Mi   has bigger display  the on paper Brightness of Mi   is higher Touch response is same on both Winner   MI Band       Pedometer   Workouts  Pedometer accuracy is almost same on both the bands But Mi   has slightly increased number of workout  even though they are not      accurate Winner   Mi Band      HR Sensor  Its same  nothing else to mention Winner   Draw    Sleep Tracker  Accuracy of both the band is similar and below     But Mi   now has Day time tracking Winner   Mi Band      Battery Backup  This was shocker for me  Mi   has almost     bigger battery being older version and gives almost     more backup Winner   MI Band     Accessories  Being in the market for a year  Mi   has advantage Winner   MI Band     Features  Though Mi   has more number of features compared to Mi    most of them are useless Winner   Draw    Price  Mi   being currently     rupees cheaper  is clear winner Winner   MI band  SCORE   Mi Band      points   Mi Band      points VERDICT                   Now  to sum up I mentioned   points  out of which Mi Band   wining by just a single point is not a great thing  Yes  there are some genuine upgrades like Magnetic dock  more customizable interface  dynamic watch faces  but these are good enough for upgrading if you already own Mi band   I would say if and only if you have Mi band   or lower version or no fitness bands at all  then go for this band as your first fitness band  Again  if you are looking for more accurate fitness band under  k with SpO  feature  then Honor Band   should be your pick Hope this helps you make sound decision ,34

TV for all Prospective Buyers and Confused Buyers,SAGAR MAGNANI,4,  Overall Analysis and Reviews for all prospective buyers     Picture Quality  The TV is definitely a worthy purchase as its Picture Quality is by far the best in class in compared to other competitors Build Quality too is Good The bezel and screen is definitely a Masterpiece as the Bezels are indeed Minimum   the way the screen is built is extremely Unique and different than other competitors can not comment on Viewing Angles as honestly I am not an expert also most people watch TV directly in straight direction and all these Viewing Angles talk is just a gimmick to confuse you all    OSEarlier reports were that the TV is very laggy especially w r t   inch however I did not experience much lag  One needs to understand that in this segment all competitors offer similar config of Ram and Processor which are definitely not high end HOWEVER like how it has been hyped on Lag part    I found it to be rather untrue as Lag exists but not to a huge extent OnePlus own software optimization is amazing as really clean and bloat free The TV remembers the last input and so turns on by default on the said input mode on boot up Tv has a unique style of Boot Up and Shut down method as on single power off press it seems TV is more on standby mode and only on Long Press of power off will the TV shutdown completely Boot up timing is good as its not too delayed    Sound   Major let down as sound is definitely not at all upto the mark however this is problem which is common amongst all competitors as each hv low Quality speakers only I already have a soundbar so this aspect anywhich ways had   impact as all competitors fail in sound aspect in these cost segment of TVs totally per my experience    Accessibility of Ports   Perhaps the major let down for me are the accesibility of the ports as they are not at all User Friendly and not readily accessible specially for people who have opted for Wall Mount like in my case The downward location of Port is the most Negative aspect for me However as I hardly use ports much so again not a major impact however for others it can seem to be a problem mainly for users who have more requirements of port like hdmi and all however with an HDMI extender you will be good to go just an investment of         rs for an extender may be required Table Top installation people have nothing to be worried off  This is least concern for them    Connectivity   Though a single band wifi Router Exists  the same works absolutely fine and   loss or issues atleast till now    Installation   Installation was a bit challenge mainly due to screw up by Third party responsible for installation however with Amazon Escalation it was handled timely and despite hiccups TV was installed on the scheduled date only by EOD there is a lot of confusion with regards to Wall Mount  well let me be clear that Wall Mount is totally Free and nothing needs to be paid at all Beware that Installation guy may make some charge and ask to pay however fight back  escalate  talk to their Manager or ask for official bill and you will be good to go as nothing will be charged then Only lack of clarity remains is around the type of Wall Mount used  as in my case   the guy used an generic brand wall Mount bracket and it is not at all clear whether Oneplus has their own branding of Wall Mount   Maybe others can add on    Remote   Remote design and all is pure beauty with minimalistic design however do not know where the issue seems to be with Remote or otherwise as it could be like at times mutilple times pressing could be required especially to Turn On the Tv  Not sure whether its remote lag or otherwise   Maybe Oneplus can fine tune with update Overall Analysis   Recommendation  Tv is definitely highly recommend for people priority and focus is Picture Quality and OS  highly recommended for OTT users like me   Bedroom TV   Best Choice If you have soundbar then do not think otherwise as its the best option from others outhere literally MI TV and All completely fail in comparison to this Got free Echo Dot too   Many complained of not getting as they did not read the offer properly as the speaker needs to be added in cart along with TV inorder for promo to apply automatically TV is not Alexa based and so could not completely reap the benefits of the same with Echo however maybe with update this could be sorted too Also for OTT users like me it should have an option that on Boot up TV starts at Google Launcher page only   Again update can take care of this  A word of advice for all confused buyer s   read my above detailed guide and then take a call Nevertheless  you will not be regretted at all with this TV  OnePlus has definitely delivered its premiumness with this TV for sure and which is highly visible too Will update the reviews if add on or change of facts What more are you looking out for    simply buy this TV Never Settle    ,51
